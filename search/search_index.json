Simply connect the XZG to your LAN Ethernet or USB, and you're all set. The XZG comes pre-flashed and prepared for immediate use. Go to installation </p> Is it possible to configure more than one XZG coordinator with a single instance of Home Assistant? <p>Certainly, that's possible. You have the ability to establish numerous XZG coordinators alongside a single Home Assistant setup. To achieve this, all you need to do is execute distinct instances of Zigbee2MQTT for each coordinator. According to user reports, approximately 6-8 LAN devices have been successfully employed in conjunction with a single Home Assistant setup. Furthermore, it's worth noting that you have the capability to link with devices situated beyond your LAN network, such as those located in different geographical locations with internet access.</p> Is it possible to remotely update the firmware of the XZG without needing physical access to the device? <p>Certainly, you have the capability to do so. The two main chips employed in the XZG (CC2652P and ESP32) can both be updated remotely from a different location. This feature makes the device well-suited for installation in infrequently accessed or remote locations.</p> What is ESP32 Autoboot feature? <p>Indeed, ESP32 Autoboot is a default feature when flashing the XZG using the type-C connection. In this context, ESP32 Autoboot refers to the built-in programming mechanism and circuitry that simplifies the process of flashing the ESP32 microcontroller. With this feature, you are not required to manually press buttons to put the ESP32 in flash mode, and you also don't need to connect additional programming tools. The process is streamlined \u2013 just connect the type-C cable and initiate the flashing process. This streamlined approach makes flashing the device straightforward and convenient.</p>"},{"location":"features/","title":"Features","text":"<p>XZG Firmware unifies the best innovations from previous Zigbee gateway projects into a single, comprehensive solution.</p> <p>By focusing the community's efforts on enhancing one product, XZG aims to streamline development, thereby improving the features and efficiency of your Zigbee Gateways. \ud83c\udf0d</p>"},{"location":"features/#key-features","title":"\ud83c\udf53 Key features","text":"Localized Translation \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 Zigbee OTA Install new Zigbee firmware or change role Coordinator / Router / OpenThread using only the Web UI of your gateway \ud83d\ude80 NVRAM Erase NVRAM using only the Web UI of your gateway \ud83c\udf89 Web UI theme \ud83c\udf1e Light or Dark \ud83c\udf11 Zigbee mode  Network or USB  Network mode  RJ45 and Wi-Fi  (simultaneously) VPN support  WireGuard MQTT client  Publish gateway states to brokers and subscribes for commands Access point  If there isn't available any wire and wireless connection NTP client  Yes Custom DNS servers  Yes (when DHCP is off), Ethernet and WiFi Realtime web updates   Without page refreshing Button    Change current modes, factory reset  LEDs  Different blinks helps to indicate current mode Disable LEDs modes    Full disable and Night     Code XZG is developed, coded and tested in Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 Build  All builds are published using GitHub Actions.
